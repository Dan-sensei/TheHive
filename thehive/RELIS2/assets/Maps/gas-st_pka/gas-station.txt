Description            : My PKA map #2.
                         An idea of converting something that I do very often on my job, for Q3 PKA world.
                         I've done a lot of advertising for russian oil company "TNK" 
                         and for ukrainian oil company "KLO", 
                         so why this is a "TNK"-style gas station (with some "KLO" elements) :)
                         The idea of disappearing land was taken from the movie "Langoliers" 
                         and the teleporter style taken from the movie "Phantasm".
